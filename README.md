# Daniel Curilla's Resume
Instead of writing a plain old word document, I wanted to try *developing* my resume using the LaTex language and Git version control. Why would one want to do such a thing? 
1. By hosting my resume on GitHub, I can view the progression of my resume over time through my commit history. I think that is pretty neat! 
2. I can avoid the annoying formatting issues that so often come with Microsoft word
3. I can hone my github version control skills
4. LaTex is a powerful tool for elegant report writing. As a data scientist & consultant, I often write technical reports for clients. Microsoft word will get you to where you want to go, but LaTex takes report writing to a whole new level. I want to use this mini project as a way to hone some soft skills too!
